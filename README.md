# EPiServer CLI
A Command Line Interface tool to *scaffold pages and blocks* (And *more stuff soon!*)

## How to use it?
You can use the tool easily in an easy-to-remember format:

`epi generate page TestPage`

You can even use it without completing the command:

`epi g page TestPage`
`epi ge page TestPage`
`epi gen page TestPage`

This command will autocomplete to this:

`epi generate page TestPage`

You can also skip the type of content to create, or the suffix:

`epi g p Test`

This command will autocomplete to this:

`epi generate page TestPage`

When executed, this command will generate the page class, controller and view! (And a view model if you use a flag. Isn't this great?)

## Do we have flags to customize the output?
